============


# What is this?

Since StackMob is now defunct, forking this code to support moving a Parse dataset to a different backend.

see [stackmob-parse-migrator](https://github.com/stackmob/stackmob-parse-migrator) for the original project


# Usage

```shell
stackmob-parse-migrator --import-path=/path/to/unzipped-json/folder --export-path=/path/to/write/processed/data
```

# Supported Import types
* Primitives data types
* Arrays
* ID fields
* Overriding createddate/lastmoddate
* Geopoints
* Dates
* Relations
* Subobjects
* Pointers

# Futures
* Binary Files

# Limitations
* Mixed type arrays are not allowed (this is a feature)
* Subobjects greater than 1 level deep can't be migrated
* StackMob doesn't support actual subobjects. Subobjects will be split off into separate relations, which can be joined together by using the expand feature
* StackMob doesn't have a date format. Dates are stored as longs in unix time
* This script loads all the objects for each collection into memory. This could lead to OOM with sufficiently large datasets

# Windows Caveats

## Python isn't installed

Please visit http://www.python.org/getit/ to download a Python distribution for your Windows platform. We have tested this script successfully on Windows 7 using ActivePython 2.7.2.

## Bad filenames

If your application uses relations in its schemas, then the zip archive you downloaded from Parse has files of the form `_Join:<relationName>:_<schemaName>.json`. Windows handles this badly, and some zip clients do too.  We recommend that you rename these files after unarchiving to the form `_Join#<relationName>#_<schemaName>.json`

## Can't find the migrator script

Windows may not be able to find `stackmob-parse-migrator` at the command prompt. If you installed the script using `pip`, then it should reside in `C:\Python27\Scripts`, or wherever your Python installation lives. Navigate to that directory, and execute the script directly from there, e.g. `python .\stackmob-parse-migrator --api_key=...`

# Contributing

This project is open source!  You are welcome to modify this and improve it as you come along.  There's such a variety of data out there that we hope we've covered, but just in case you find any corner cases, we and other developers would truly be grateful for your contributions :)  Thanks, and happy coding!
